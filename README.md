## üíª Project

We programmers work in front of the computer sitting and in the same position for hours and hours. This project was developed using the time management pomodoro technique, which consists of you focusing on your work for 25 minutes and after that time a challenge is given to you, for example, stretching your arms, resting your eyes, or getting up from the chair and walk around a bit. If you complete the challenge you gain bridges of experiences that influence your level, otherwise, if you fail the challenge, you will not gain anything at all. As your level up, you need more and more experience for the next level.

This is a project developed during the Next Level Week, presented by [@Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat) during February 22-28, 2021.
